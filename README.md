My attempt at an interpreter for a "functional Forth" mini language.

Inspired by the Joy programming language - a purely functional programming language that was produced by Manfred von Thun of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. 
Joy is based on composition of functions rather than lambda calculus. 
It has turned out to have many similarities to Forth, due not to design but to a sort of parallel evolution and convergence
