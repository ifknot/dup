![joy logo](https://cldup.com/zIkm02BrOD.jpg)

Inspired by the [Joy programming language](https://github.com/ifknot/joycpp/wiki/Joy-&-Manfred-von-Thun) by Manfred von thun (2001).

Joy is kind of a cross between Forth and Lisp. 

Like Lisp, lists are a key data structures, and a program can be represented by a list. Unlike Lisp (and like Forth), a program stack is used for argument passing/return, and also replaces let-bindings and the like. 

__Therefore, there are no "variable names" in Joy.__
