Inspired by the Joy programming language.

Joy programming language - a purely functional programming language that was produced by Manfred von Thun of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. 
Joy is based on composition of functions rather than lambda calculus. 
It has turned out to have many similarities to Forth, due not to design but to a sort of parallel evolution and convergence.

According to the LaTrobe University Alumni news,

"Alumni and staff will be saddened to hear of the death of Manfred von Thun on 23 October after a long illness. Manfred was a member of the philosophy department from early 1972 until his retirement in 2003, but remained an honorary associate until 2009. Manfred specialized in logic, philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, computer programming and cybernetics. He was also renowned for developing the computer programming language, Joy. He will be sadly missed."
